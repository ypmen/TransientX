TransientX is a high performance software package for searching for radio transient.
The input data format can be sigproc filterband or psrfits.

Tools
--------
There are two tools currently implemented in TransientX:

transientx_fil
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A single pulse search pipeline which can be run with a single command line. The pipeline include

.. toctree::
	:maxdepth: 1

	pipeline/preprocess
	pipeline/rfi_mitigation
	pipeline/dedispersion
	pipeline/matched_filtering
	pipeline/clustering
	pipeline/candidate_plotting

It produces candidate plots in PNG format and generates a candidate list. A diagram illustrating the pipeline is shown in :doc:`pipeline`. The options are described in detail in the :doc:`usage/transientx_fil <usage/transientx_fil>`.

replot_fil
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A tool to reprocess candidates generated by transientx_fil. It removes duplicate and bad candidates based on multiple criteria, and can generate archive files for further analysis. A diagram illustrating the pipeline is shown in :doc:`pipeline`.
The options are introduced in detail in the :doc:`usage/replot_fil <usage/replot_fil>`.
